# lean-category-theory-pr

This is a temporary staging area for code that we plan extract from [lean-category-theory](https://github.com/semorrison/lean-category-theory) and pull request into [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib).

## TODO
1. Clean up.
2. Fix remaining TODOs
3. Minimise (remove?) the dependency on `lean-tidy`. (A good strategy may be to progressively move the imports from lean-tidy to later and later files.)
4. Pull request!
