# lean-category-theory-pr

This used to be a temporary staging area for code that we plan extract from [lean-category-theory](https://github.com/semorrison/lean-category-theory) and pull request into [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib).

It is now archived, and you should you either `mathlib` or `lean-category-theory` directly, depending on what you need.
