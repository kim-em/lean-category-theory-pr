The universe annotations may be suprising here!
Note that we ask the Obj : Type (u+1), while Hom X Y : Type u.
This is motivated by:
1. As `category` is a class, we want all universe levels to be determined by its parameters.
   (Thus we want to avoid independent universe levels for Obj and Hom.)
2. The basic example of category is the category of types and functions.
   This example matches the definition here.
3. It so far doesn't seem to cause any problems!

/- 
The propositional fields of `category` are annotated with the auto_param `obviously_stub`, which is just a synonym for `skip`.
Actually, there is a tactic called `obviously` which is not part of this pull request, which should be used here. It successfully
discharges a great many of these goals. For now, proofs which could be provided entirely by `obviously` (and hence omitted entirely
and discharged by an auto_param), are all marked with a comment "-- obviously says:".
